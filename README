This package is a source code for Frame Manager Configuration tool.

The Frame Manager Configuration tool is a software package whose primary
purpose is converting Parse-Classify-Police-Distribute (PCD) descriptions of
network packets flow into hardware configuration. The tool provides an
abstraction layer between the end customer's vision of the PCD task definition
and real hardware implementation.
Trying to achieve this aim, the tool frees customers from the need to learn new
hardware implementations details, gives a quick start for new customers
and simplifies the work for experienced users. In addition, the tool can be used
for hardware verification, permitting a wide range of input parameters
in fast and convenient form.
