Build steps for FMC:
   - The package is dependent on the following external packages that should
     be installed on your system:
       - xmllib2
       - tclap
       - fmd user space library

   - Set environment variables or modify Makefile with the following entries:
       - FMD_USPACE_HEADER_PATH - path to fmd user space package headers location
       - FMD_USPACE_LIB_PATH    - path to fmd user space package library location
       - LIBXML2_HEADER_PATH    - path to libxml2 include files
       - TCLAP_HEADER_PATH      - path to TCLAP include files

   - Issue 'make' command
   
   - For host side compilation (the mode in which FMC doesn't use
     direct libfm API calls), use 'make FMCHOSTMODE=1' command

Install steps for FMC:
   - After successful compilation, put 'fmc' application to
     /usr/bin folder of your target
   - Copy 'etc' folder to /etc folder of your target

Install verification:
    fmc --help
    command should provide list of command line options available

    fmc -p sample.xml -c config.xml
    command will produce an example configuration source code

    fmc -p sample.xml -c config.xml -a
    command will apply the configuration to Frame Manager hardware block
    (when running on a target system)
